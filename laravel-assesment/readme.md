# Obigtech Laravel Backend Coding Challenge


Hi!

The goal is to use Laravel to develop a basic CRM app.

## Requirements

- Use Laravel 8.x
- **Basic Laravel Auth**: ability to log in as administrator
- Use database seeds to create first user with email admin@admin.com and password “password”
- Create the first user with the email admin@admin.com and the password "password" using database seeds.
- The fields of the Companies DB database are as follows: Name, email, logo (minimum 100x100), and website are all necessary.
- The fields of the Employees DB database are as follows: Company (foreign key to Companies), first name (required), last name (mandatory), email, and phone.
- To construct the schemas shown above, use database migrations.
- Keep company logos in a storage/app/public folder.
- Use default methods in Laravel resource controllers such as index, create, and store.
- Make use of Laravel's validation feature and Request classes.
- To display a list of companies/employees, use Laravel's pagination, with 10 entries per page.
- Boostrap authentication with Laravel jetstream.

Additional options:

- Provide a REST API for all CRUD operations.
- Include an authorisation token in the API.
- Include Seeding to populate the database with initial data (companies and employees)
- Boostrap Auth UI using Laravel Jetstream React Stack 

## Criteria

Your work will be evaluated primarily on:

1. Pay close attention to code quality, formatting, and conventions, among other things.
2. Attempt to optimize your images :)
3. README.md file explaining your high level solution and any decisions you made and the reasons behind them.
4. Give us access to your GitHub repository.
5. Don't sweat the front end; all you have to do is make it look 'decent' using Tailwind.
